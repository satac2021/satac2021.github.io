    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Symposium on Applications of Thermal
      Analysis and&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Calorimetry - 2021</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It gives us pleasure in inviting you to the
      Symposium on Applications of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (SATAC-2021)
      which is being organised in hybrid mode (virtual/physical- in view of the
      pandemic) in the University Department of Chemistry, Magadh University,
      Bodh Gaya-824234 (India) during December 21-22, 2021.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> It will be an excellent opportunity for the
      researchers, academicians and students interested in any branch of Thermal
      Analysis to discuss applications and results of their latest research
      works. Lectures will be organised and papers shall be presented. Limited
      participation in physical mode will also be there. The first such SATAC
      was held in India at Panjab University, Chandigarh in December 2010 and
      the Indian Council of Chemists (ICC) had taken the lead by organizing
      "SATAC-2010".&nbsp; A special Volume was also brought out (Vol 107, No 1,
      January 2012) by Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry to
      commemorate the event. Similarly, a special issue was brought out
      commemorating SATAC 2011. Sessions on interfaces with other branches of
      Chemical Sciences will also be held. </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Venue</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The venue is the University Department of
      Chemistry, Magadh University, Bodh Gaya-824234 (India). It is a flagship
      department of Magadh University (www.magadhuniversity.ac.in) which is the
      largest university in the eastern state of Bihar in India.&nbsp; Beyond
      the 34 Departments and Centers situated in the sprawling campus of the
      University at Bodh Gaya –the place where Lord Buddha got enlightenment
      over 2500 years ago, the University administers 19 constituent and 39
      affiliated colleges, 1 Engineering college, 2 Law colleges and 2 Dental
      colleges which are spread over the Gaya, Nawada, Jehanabad, Arwal and
      Aurangabad districts of the state. Bodh Gaya is well connected and the
      university is situated on NH 83 which connects Patna, Gaya to NH-2
      (Delhi-Kolkata Highway). Nearest airport is Gaya (6 km) and the nearest
      Railway Station is Gaya Jn which is well connected to Howrah/Kolkata
      (5-7hrs), Patna (2-3 hrs), Delhi (11-17 km), Mumbai, Chennai, Goa, Pune,

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img src="assets/Chemistry.png" alt="Deptt" title="Deptt" longdesc="Deptt">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Department got the tag of “DST-FIST
      Sponsored” from the Department of Science and Technology, Govt of India
      in 2009 and it had also acquired the privilege of “UGC-BSR Supported”.
      Earlier it was recognized as a leading centre under the Faculty
      Improvement Programme of the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 1977.
      The Department hosted the 27th Annual Convention of Chemists and the
      annual conference of the Indian Chemical Society during 26-30 December
      1990 under the Chairmanship of Professor B. P. Verma. Concurrent sessions
      were held in seven Sections. Renowned scientist working in the field of
      Thermal Analysis, Prof Ranjit K Verma formed a small group of thermal
      analysts here after joining the Dept in 1983. The group marked its
      presence worldwide and Dr Ranjit Verma who became Professor in 1993,
      became the Secretary of ICTAC (International Confederation for Thermal
      Analysis and Calorimetry) in 2012. Presently he is Vice Chairman of the
      Scientific Commission of ICTAC (www.ictac.org). He is also on the
      Editorial Board of the Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry
      [published by Springer, Thomson Reuters Impact Factor 4.626(2020)] –the
      oldest and leading research journal in the field.&nbsp; Regional Branch of
      Indian Chemical Society was opened in the Department in 1990 and the
      Magadh Chapter of Indian Science Congress was started in 1997. Prof Verma
      is going to superannuate on 31st December this year.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; To maintain pace with the current growing field of the Chemistry,
      the Department frequently organizes seminars, conference and colloquium in
      the frontier areas of Chemistry. Eminent scientists and educationists from
      India and abroad have been visiting the Department and have delivered
      lectures and attended seminars, workshops etc. Apart from many completed
      projects from the Department, ongoing project is sponsored by Department
      of Science and Technology, SERB, New Delhi. </p>
